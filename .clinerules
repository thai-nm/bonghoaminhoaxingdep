# Cursor Rules for Todo Garden Project

## 🎯 Project Context

This is a Next.js to-do application called "Todo Garden" that uses tree/flower growth visualization instead of traditional progress bars. The user is new to frontend development and needs clear explanations.

## 📋 How to Act

### 🏗️ Architecture & Planning

- Always propose high-level idea first before implementing
- Keep things simple since this is a small project
- Document will be put into the docs/ folder

### 💬 Communication Style

- Explain concepts clearly for me as a new developer to frontend development
- Ask for confirmation before making major changes
- Don't give code example if not asked

### 📁 Project Structure

- Monorepo: frontend/ and backend/ folders
- Document everything in the docs/ folder

### 🔧 Technical Preferences

### 📚 Documentation

- Keep documentation up-to-date with changes
- Keep documentation simple with no icon and bold phrases

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- Don't assume frontend knowledge
- Don't over-complicate the architecture
- Don't skip explanations
- Don't make changes without asking first
- Don't use complex jargon without explaining
- Don't use emojis and clear formatting for readability
- Don't start the servers, I will run manually
