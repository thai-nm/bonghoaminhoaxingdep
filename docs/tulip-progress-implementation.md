# Tulip Progress Implementation

## Overview

The Todo Garden application now uses a tulip flower spritesheet-based progress visualization instead of traditional progress bars. This creates a more engaging and thematic experience where users can watch their tulip grow as they complete tasks.

## Implementation Details

### TulipGrowth Component

**Location**: `frontend/src/components/TulipGrowth.tsx`

**Purpose**: Displays a tulip that grows through different stages based on task completion progress.

### Key Features

1. **4 Growth Stages**: The tulip progresses through 4 distinct visual stages:
   - Stage 0 (0%): Seed/empty soil - "Plant your first seed by completing a task!"
   - Stage 1 (1-49%): Small sprout - "A tiny sprout appears! Keep going!"
   - Stage 2 (50-99%): Growing tulip - "Your tulip is growing beautifully!"
   - Stage 3 (100%): Full bloom - "ðŸŒ· Your tulip is in full bloom! Beautiful work!"

2. **Smooth Animations**: Uses Framer Motion for smooth transitions between stages

3. **Sparkle Effect**: When fully grown (stage 3), a sparkle animation appears

4. **Progress Text**: Shows completion count and percentage alongside the visual

### Image Configuration

- **Files**: Individual tulip images `tulip-000.png` to `tulip-003.png`
- **Format**: 4 separate PNG files for each growth stage
- **Location**: `frontend/public/tulip-000.png` through `frontend/public/tulip-003.png`
- **Rendering**: Fixed height (200px) with auto width for consistent display

### Integration

The TulipGrowth component is integrated into the TodoList component (`frontend/src/components/TodoList.tsx`) and replaces the previous progress bar visualization.

```tsx
{/* Tulip Growth Visualization */}
{totalCount > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-6">
    <TulipGrowth 
      completedCount={completedCount} 
      totalCount={totalCount} 
    />
  </div>
)}
```

### Props Interface

```tsx
interface TulipGrowthProps {
  completedCount: number  // Number of completed tasks
  totalCount: number      // Total number of tasks
}
```

### Styling Features

- **Responsive Design**: Centers the tulip and scales appropriately
- **Pixel Art Rendering**: Uses `imageRendering: 'pixelated'` for crisp image display
- **Fixed Height**: Consistent 200px height with auto width for proper aspect ratio
- **Garden Theme**: Consistent with the overall garden aesthetic of the application

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: More engaging than traditional progress bars
2. **Thematic Consistency**: Aligns with the "garden" theme of the application
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear progression stages motivate task completion
4. **Smooth Animations**: Professional feel with smooth transitions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Different flower types for different achievement levels
- Seasonal variations
- Multiple tulips for different categories of tasks
- Sound effects for stage transitions
