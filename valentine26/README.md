# Project: Valentine 2026

This is a fun and simple static website for my girlfriend for our 2026 Valentine, inspired by several online videos, such as [this](https://www.tiktok.com/@mewtru/video/7470576702603808046).

## Description

A simple but fun static website to ask someone to hang out in Valentine. It will show a question:

"Will you be my valentine?"

And Yes/NO answer boxes.

The funny thing is that it will not allow the user to click the No button, by moving the No button every time the user tries to click it or move their mouse near the button.

Also, the Yes button becomes bigger every time the user clicks.
