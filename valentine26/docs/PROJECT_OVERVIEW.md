# PROJECT OVERVIEW: Valentine 2026

## Introduction
A fun and simple static website created for a special 2026 Valentine's Day. Inspired by interactive viral TikToks, this project asks a simple question: "Will you be my valentine?" in an engaging and humorous way.

## Concept
- **The Question**: "Will you be my valentine?"
- **Interactive No Button**: Moves around and becomes harder to click as you try to hover over it.
- **The Growing Yes Button**: Becomes larger each time it's clicked.
- **Success Celebration**: Shows festive visual effects and a specific GIF when "Yes" is clicked.

## Project Vision
Create a memorable, sweet, and fun digital experience that is lightweight, easy to deploy, and themed for romance.
